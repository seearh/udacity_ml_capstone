Udacity Machine Learning Starbucks Capstone Project
by Tay Cong Run

All code are run from 3 Jupyter Notebooks, one of which imports from a Python module:
1) Data Preview and Transformation
2) Data Exploration
3) Data Cleaning and Model Training

Some libraries employed include:
- standard data analyses tools pandas and numpy
- visualization libraries seaborn and matplotlib
- data cleaning library feature-engine
- machine learning library scikit-learn
- progress tracker tqdm

Virtual environments to run all code can be set-up using pip or conda.
The comprehensive requirement.txt for both set-up methods are included:
1) pip_requirement.txt for pip
2) conda_requirement.txt for conda
